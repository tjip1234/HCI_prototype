# HCI_prototype
here is the apk for the prototype of my app. you can run this by installing it directly on your android phone or by using an emulator on your computer.
There is an emulator build in in android studio, or you can use third party solutions like bluestack. 

This is the source code in case you have android studio install you can pull this and look at it from the xml viewers directly instead of installing it:
